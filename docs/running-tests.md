# Running tests

Once the plugin (or jest transformer) is wired up and your `.md` files are in
`test.include` / `testMatch`, runnable doctests show up alongside your normal
test files in `pnpm test` output.

## What you'll see

Each `.md` file appears as one test file. Inside it, every `test`-marked
block becomes one `it()` named after the nearest heading. A docs file with
two marked blocks under headings `Adds` and `Negs` reports as:

```
✓ docs/sum.md (2)
  ✓ Adds
  ✓ Negs
```

Files with no marked blocks transform into an empty module (`export {}`) and
report as zero tests — no errors, no noise. Safe to leave the `.md` glob
broad.

## Filtering

Standard vitest/jest filtering applies to doctests too. They're regular
test cases as far as the runner is concerned.

- vitest: `pnpm vitest -t "Adds"` runs only matching test names; `pnpm vitest docs/sum.md` runs only that file.
- jest: `pnpm jest -t "Adds"`; `pnpm jest docs/sum.md`.

## Focusing or skipping individual blocks

To narrow further than the runner's filtering, edit the fence itself with
[`only` or `skip`](/options/). Useful while iterating on a single doctest.

## Debugging a failing doctest

When a doctest fails, the runner reports the synthetic test module name
(`__out.ts`) and the line within the _generated_ code, not the line in your
`.md`. Source-map generation back to the original `.md` line numbers is on
the roadmap; until then, the typical workflow is:

1. Look at the test name in the failure (it's the heading or `name="..."`).
2. Open the `.md`, find that heading.
3. The block under it is the failing one.

Most doctest blocks are short enough that step 3 is unambiguous.

## Watch mode

Both vitest and jest's watch modes pick up `.md` edits automatically — vite's
file watcher tracks markdown alongside `.ts`. Save a `.md` change and the
relevant doctests re-run on the next tick.
